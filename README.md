Methods:

-Descriptive Statistics using data.table

-Pooled Multinomial Logit with and without state-dependence

-Latent Class Multinomial Logit

-Panel Multinomial Logit (taking into account that our panel is unbalanced: each household has a different number of purchases during the period of observation)
